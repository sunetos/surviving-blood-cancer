-# Part One: Orientation {#orientation}

This book is split into two parts: the orientation and the topical guides. I
recommend reading the entire orientation as soon as possible to get in the right
mindset for this stage of your life; it's not that long.

In the [topical part](#topics), each chapter covers a particular topic in some
detail. I have attempted to stick to the information that is immediately
relevant to you as a current patient, so you could benefit by reading this book
cover to cover. However, there is enough detail in each chapter to serve as a
useful introduction to the topic and kick-start further research. It is up to
you if you would rather read it as a reference than a guide.
