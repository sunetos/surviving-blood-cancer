# Your first day {#first-day}

If you just got the call from your doctor and are brand new to the world of
blood cancer, let me just say I'm sorry and I'm glad you have this book.

Unless you are already admitted to a hospital or on a rushed timeline (like a
stage IV tumor), I recommend that you put this book down for a day or two and
talk things out with family and friends.

The only other advice I can give at this point is to include your significant
other (if you have one) in your grief and thoughts. The coming days will be
extremely hard for them in ways you are unlikely to understand or be able to
help with.
