# The First Ten Things You Should Know

## Personality

I believe most patients can be roughly divided into two categories.

- Those who want to know everything, including reasons/motivation.
- Those who just want to know what to do next.

There is an implication that the first group is less trusting of their
environment, and second-guess frequently. I am one of these people. The more
trusting second group "lets the doctors do their jobs," and generally worry
less.

While I personally triple-guessed every little detail I could, at times I was
unable to and I experiened both sides of this behavior. I propose that neither
is better (and certainly not "right or wrong"), and you are who you are. I will
try to cater to both types throughout the book.

## The Ten Things

If this is your first personal experience with cancer, you can't possibly know
what you are even preparing for. After years of various brutal treatments, these
are the top ten things I was not prepared for (or even warned about).

- You are not ready, and you're ok.
- You will lose your dignity.
- You will not recover 100%.
- You will receive many, many blood transfusions.
- You will have encounters with anxiety, panic, depression, and more.
- You need family.
- You will learn more about medicine than you likely wanted to.
- You will likely not have children again.
- You need to stop working.
